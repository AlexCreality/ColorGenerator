# ColorGenerator
An algorithm for generating various color schemes (e.g. analogous color schemes) via additive color scheme (RGB).

User should determine a number of colors for generating, a color generating principle (determined/random) and
original color (R,G,B from 0 to 255) for generating.

# BrightnessGenerator
An algorithm for generating various one or more colors with various brightness via additive color scheme (RGB).

User should determine a number of colors (from original color to absolute white) or a percent to increase
brightness of original color (R,G,B from 0 to 255) for generating.
